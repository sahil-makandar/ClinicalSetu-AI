# ClinicalSetu - Prototype Build Checklist

**Hackathon:** AI for Bharat (Professional Track - Healthcare & Life Sciences)
**Deadline:** March 4, 2026 | 11:59 PM IST
**Budget:** $100 AWS credits

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Evaluation Order (Sequential & Eliminative)

```
STEP 1: PPT reviewed first        → If fails, NOTHING else is reviewed
STEP 2: Demo Video reviewed next   → Only if PPT passes
STEP 3: Working Prototype URL      → Only if Video passes
STEP 4: GitHub Repository          → Only if all above pass
```

**Priority order for our work: PPT > Video > Live Prototype > Code Quality**

## DAY 2 (Mar 1) - Deploy + PPT 🔄 TODAY

### MORNING: Deploy Agentic Backend to AWS (Person A)
- [ ] Deploy **ClinicalSetu-ToolExecutor** Lambda (agent_tool_executor.py, 1024MB, 120s timeout)
- [ ] Deploy **ClinicalSetu-Invoker** Lambda (invoke_agent.py, 256MB, 120s timeout)
- [ ] Run `python scripts/setup_bedrock_agent.py` to provision:
  - [ ] S3 bucket with clinical trials data
  - [ ] IAM roles (Agent role + KB role)
  - [ ] Bedrock Agent with Claude 3 Sonnet
  - [ ] Action Group with 4 clinical tools
  - [ ] Agent alias (production)
- [ ] Set Agent ID + Alias ID as env vars on Invoker Lambda
- [ ] Create API Gateway REST API (`POST /api/process`, CORS enabled) → Invoker Lambda
- [ ] **Optional**: Create Bedrock Knowledge Base for RAG trial matching
- [ ] Deploy frontend to AWS Amplify (connect GitHub, get live URL)
- [ ] Test end-to-end on live URL

### MORNING: Frontend Polish (Person B)
- [ ] Wire frontend to live API Gateway URL
- [ ] Test end-to-end: text in → 4 AI outputs displayed
- [ ] Handle loading states and error scenarios
- [ ] Take screenshots of every screen for PPT

### AFTERNOON: PPT - THE #1 PRIORITY (Both people)
- [ ] **Slide 1:** Title + Team Sahrova + "Capture Once. Reuse Responsibly."
- [ ] **Slide 2:** Problem (4 pain points: documentation burden, poor continuity, fragmented referrals, missed trials) + India stats (1 doctor per 1,511 people, 500+ patients/day in govt OPDs)
- [ ] **Slide 3:** Solution overview - single input → 4 AI outputs diagram
- [ ] **Slide 4:** Architecture diagram (Prototype: solid lines + Production: dashed lines)
  - Must clearly show: React → Amplify → API Gateway → Invoker Lambda → **Bedrock Agent** → Tool Executor Lambda → Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)
  - Also show: Bedrock Agent → Knowledge Base (RAG) → S3
- [ ] **Slide 5:** AWS Services - WHY each service + HOW it's used + WHAT value it adds
  - **Bedrock Agent**: Agentic orchestration - DECIDES which tools to call based on consultation
  - **Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)**: Foundation model for clinical reasoning
  - **Knowledge Bases**: RAG pipeline for semantic trial matching
  - **Lambda** (x2): Serverless compute - Invoker + Tool Executor
  - **API Gateway**: Secure REST API with CORS
  - **Amplify**: CI/CD + hosting from GitHub
  - **S3**: Clinical trial data store for KB
- [ ] **Slide 6:** AI Pipeline deep-dive - **agentic tool use**, prompt engineering, JSON schema validation, confidence scoring
- [ ] **Slide 7:** Demo screenshots (SOAP Note, Patient Summary, Referral Letter, Trial Matches)
- [ ] **Slide 8:** Responsible AI - non-diagnostic by design, doctor-in-the-loop validation, "AI-Generated" disclaimers, synthetic data only, Bedrock Guardrails
- [ ] **Slide 9:** India Impact - ABDM alignment, rural telemedicine, multilingual roadmap, clinical trial access democratization
- [ ] **Slide 10:** RAG Pipeline for Trial Matching - S3 → Titan Embeddings → Knowledge Base → semantic search → confidence scoring
- [ ] **Slide 11:** Production Roadmap - Cognito auth, Step Functions orchestration, DynamoDB persistence, Transcribe Medical speech-to-text, HealthLake FHIR
- [ ] **Slide 12:** Summary + key differentiators + call to action

### Must answer these 3 questions clearly in PPT (evaluation criteria):
- [ ] **WHY AI is required:** Unstructured clinical narratives → structured multi-format outputs. Rule-based systems can't do this.
- [ ] **HOW AWS services are used:** Architecture slide shows exact service-to-service flow
- [ ] **WHAT value the AI layer adds:** 4 outputs from 1 input, confidence scoring, trial matching via RAG

## DAY 3 (Mar 2) - Demo Video + Polish

### MORNING: Demo Video (max 3 min) - THE #2 PRIORITY
- [ ] Write script (every second counts)
- [ ] 0:00-0:20 Problem statement (Indian healthcare documentation burden)

- [ ] 0:40-2:00 LIVE demo walkthrough:
  - Login → select doctor
  - Load sample case OR enter narrative
  - Click "Process with AI" → show progress
  - Show SOAP Note tab (confidence scores, structured output)
  - Show Patient Summary tab (plain language)
  - Show Referral Letter tab (urgency, checklist)
  - Show Trial Matches tab (confidence bars, matched criteria)
  - Edit a section → Approve → Finalize
- [ ] 2:00-2:30 AWS services deep-dive (show architecture diagram)
- [ ] 2:30-2:50 Impact (30M consultations/day, ABDM, rural access)
