He reports his fasting blood sugar at home has been running between 140-160 mg/dL over the past month. He says he has been taking Glycomet GP 2 regularly but admits to being irregular with his evening walk. He complains of occasional tingling in both feet for the past 2 weeks, worse at night. No visual disturbances. He also mentions feeling more tired than usual. He has a history of hypertension controlled on Telmisartan 40mg daily. No chest pain, no breathlessness. Family history of diabetes in mother. On examination, BP is 138/86 mmHg, pulse 78/min regular, weight 82 kg. BMI calculated at 28.4. Foot examination shows diminished sensation to monofilament testing in both feet, dorsalis pedis pulses palpable bilaterally. Rest of the systemic examination is unremarkable. HbA1c from last month was 8.2%. I'm going to increase his Glycomet GP to the GP 3 formulation, add Tab Pregabalin 75mg at bedtime for the neuropathy symptoms, and order a comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid profile, urine microalbumin, and a repeat HbA1c in 3 months. I've also advised strict dietary control and at least 30 minutes of walking daily. I want to refer him to an ophthalmologist for a diabetic retinopathy screening since it hasn't been done in over a year. Follow up in 6 weeks.",
